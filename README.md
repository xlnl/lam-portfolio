## Tech Used
* Notion & Github - for project management 
* Figma - for wireframes 
* Adobe Illustrator - for design assets
* [DrawKit](https://www.drawkit.io/) & [Undraw](https://undraw.co/) - for beautiful, customizable illustrations

## General Approach
The purpose of this project was to showcase my work relating to software development in addition to the writing/research I've done within the past two years. 

The goal is to present myself as a creative, capable analyst developer who has great care for collaboration, details, and digital transformation as it relates to international development. 

## User Stories
### MVP
As a user, I want to be able to: 
* see a landing page before I can read more
* see a sticky navbar with a menu of the apps pages
* see a smooth, visually appealing display of the projects and research papers
* see a contact section with relevant information
### STRETCH
As a user, I want to be able to: 
* use a carousel/gallery of sorts to see details of just one project at a time 
* read more about other works beyond web applications
* connect using a contact form that directs message to an inbox 
* see tasteful animations that doesn't distract from the contact
* download the resume directly from the app 


## Major Hurdles & Unsolved Problems 
Presenting visually appealing data is a top priority for me as I developed this portfolio. I scoured the net for the best carousel component as I found Chakra-UI to lack a component that was as flexible and customizable as I would like. 

My next step is to optimize for mobile users and improve the responsiveness of the app.
